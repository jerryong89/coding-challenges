Burglary Series (10): Calculate Difference
The insurance guy calls again and apologizes. They found another policy made by your spouse, but this one is limited to cover a particular maximum in losses (for example, 50,000€). You send a bill to your spouse for the difference you lost.

Given an object of the stolen items and a limit, return the difference between the total value of those items and the limit of the policy.

Examples
calculateDifference({ "baseball bat": 20 }, 5) ➞ 15

calculateDifference({ skate: 10, painting: 20 }, 19) ➞ 11

calculateDifference({ skate: 200, painting: 200, shoes: 1 }, 400) ➞ 1
Notes
The object will always contain items (no empty objects).
The sum of the items will always be greater than the limit.

My Solution

function calculateDifference(obj, limit) {
	const x = Object.values(obj)
	const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue;
	return x.reduce(reducer) - limit
}
