Learn Lodash: _.drop, Drop the First Elements of an Array
According to the lodash documentation, _.drop creates a slice of an array with n elements dropped from the beginning.

Your challenge is to write your own version using vanilla JavaScript.

Examples
drop([1, 2, 3], 1) ➞ [2, 3]

drop([1, 2, 3], 2) ➞ [3]

drop([1, 2, 3], 5) ➞ []

drop([1, 2, 3], 0) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
Notes
Do not attempt to import lodash; you are simply writing your own version.
