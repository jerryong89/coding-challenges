ES6: Destructuring Objects IV
const obj =  { first: "James", last: "Baker", alias: "JB"  }

var { first = "John", last = "Doe", alias } = obj

console.log(nickname) // outputs nickname is not defined
There may be times where we would like the property name to be different from the object property names we receive and also give those new property names a default value.

Question
Use ES6 object destructuring to rename the variable alias to nickname and give nickname a default value of "JD". Ignore the .toString() function (used for validation).

My Solution

const str = `({ first = "John", last = "Doe", alias : nickname = "JD" } = { first: "James", last: "Baker" }).toString()`
