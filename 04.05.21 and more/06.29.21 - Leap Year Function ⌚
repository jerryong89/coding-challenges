Leap Year Function ⌚
Write a function that returns true if a year is a leap, otherwise return false.

A year is a "leap year" if it lasts 366 days, instead of 365 in a typical year. That extra day is added to the end of the shortest month, creating February 29.

A leap year occurs every four years, and will take place if the year is a multiple of four. The exception to this is a year at the beginning of a century (for example, 1900 or 2000), where the year must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

Look at the examples, and if you need help, look at the resources panel.

Examples
leapYear(1990) ➞ false

leapYear(1924) ➞ true

leapYear(2021) ➞ false

function leapYear(year) {
	if (year === 1900 || year === 2000) {
		return false 
	}
	if (year % 4 === 0) {
		return true 
	} else return false
}
