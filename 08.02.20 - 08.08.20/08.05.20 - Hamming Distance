Hamming Distance
Hamming distance is the number of characters that differ between two strings.

To illustrate:

String1: "abcbba"
String2: "abcbda"

Hamming Distance: 1 - "b" vs. "d" is the only difference.
Create a function that computes the hamming distance between two strings.

Examples
hammingDistance("abcde", "bcdef") ➞ 5

hammingDistance("abcde", "abcde") ➞ 0

hammingDistance("strong", "strung") ➞ 1
Notes
Both strings will have the same length.

My Solution

function hammingDistance(str1, str2) {
	let counter = 0;
	
	for (let i = 0; i < str1.length; i++) {
		if (str1[i] !== str2[i]) {
			counter++
		}
	}
	
	return counter
}
