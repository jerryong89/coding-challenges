Change Every Letter to the Next Letter
Write a function that changes every letter to the next letter:

"a" becomes "b"
"b" becomes "c"
"d" becomes "e"
and so on ...
Examples
move("hello") ➞ "ifmmp"

move("bye") ➞ "czf"

move("welcome") ➞ "xfmdpnf"
Notes
There will be no z's in the tests.

My Solution

function move(word) {
	let result = "";
	
	for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
		result += String.fromCharCode( word.charCodeAt([i]) +1 )
	}
	
	return result
}
