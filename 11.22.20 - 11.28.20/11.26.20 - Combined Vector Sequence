Combined Vector Sequence
The goal is to test if a consecutive sequence is formed. A consecutive sequence is defined as sequence of incrementing numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 5, 6, 7, 8). The twist is that you have to consider the combination of vectors as shown.

[3 5 1 -5 ]  =>  [3+4  5+3  1+8  15-5]  =  [7 8 9 10]  =>  true
[4 3 8 15]
Also important is that the vectors can be of different sizes, where excess numbers on the larger one will be paired with 0s from the other ones.

[2 2 2  ]  =>  [2+5  2+6  2+7  10+0]  = [ 7 8 9 10]  =>  true
[5 6 7 10]

My Solution

function hasConsecutiveSeries(v1, v2) {
	for (let i = 0; i < v1.length; i++) {
		v2[i] = v1[i] + v2[i]
	}
	let count = v2[0]
	
	for (let j = 0; j < v2.length; j++) {
		if (v2[j] !== count) {
			return false
		}
		count++
	}
	return true
}
