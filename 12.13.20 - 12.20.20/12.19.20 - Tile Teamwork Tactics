Tile Teamwork Tactics
In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided dice. If you advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.

Given you and your friend's tile number, create a function that returns if it's possible to earn a bonus when you roll the dice.

Examples
possibleBonus(3, 7) ➞ true

possibleBonus(1, 9) ➞ false

possibleBonus(5, 3) ➞ false

My Solution

function possibleBonus(a, b) {
	if (b < a || a === b || b-a >= 7) {
		return false
	} else return true
}
