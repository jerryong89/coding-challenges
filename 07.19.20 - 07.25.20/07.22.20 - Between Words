Between Words
Write a function that takes three string arguments (first, last, and word) and returns true if word is found between first and last in the dictionary, otherwise false.

Examples
isBetween("apple", "banana", "azure") ➞ true

isBetween("monk", "monument", "monkey") ➞ true

isBetween("bookend", "boolean", "boost") ➞ false
Notes
All letters will be in lowercase.
All three words will be different.
Remember that the string word is in the middle.

My Solution

function isBetween(first, last, word) {
	const arr = [first, word, last]
	let arr2 = [first, word, last].sort()

	if (arr[0] === arr2[0] && arr[1] === arr2[1] && arr[2] === arr2[2]){
		return true
	} else return false
	}
