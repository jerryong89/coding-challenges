Count the Digits
Create a function that will count the number of digits of a number. Conversion of the number to a string is not allowed, thus, the approach is either recursive or via loops.

Examples
digitsCount(0) ➞ 1

digitsCount(12345)  ➞ 5

digitsCount(1289396387328) ➞ 13
Notes
All inputs are integers but some are in exponential form, so, deal with it accordingly.

function digitsCount(n) {
	if (n ===0) return 1
	
	let abs = Math.abs(n)
  var count = 0;
  if (abs >= 1) ++count;
  while (abs / 10 >= 1) {
    abs /= 10;
    ++count;
  }
  return count;
}
