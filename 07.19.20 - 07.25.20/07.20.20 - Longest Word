Longest Word
Write a function that finds the longest word in a sentence and returns it. If two or more words are the biggest, return the word closest to the start of the sentence. Characters such as apostophe, commas, periods, etc count as letters (e.g. O'Connor is 8 characters long).

Examples
longestWord("Hello darkness my old friend") ➞ "darkness"

longestWord("Hello there mate") ➞ "Hello"

longestWord("Kayla's toy is plastic") ➞ "Kayla's"

	let hi = sentence.split(" ")
	let result = hi[0].length
	let index = 0
	
	for (let i = 0; i < hi.length; i++) {
		if (result < hi[i].length){
			result = hi[i].legnth
			index = i
		}
	}
