Re-Form the Word
A word has been split into a left part and a right part. Re-form the word by adding both halves together, changing the first character to an uppercase letter.

Examples
getWord("seas", "onal") ➞ "Seasonal"

getWord("comp", "lete") ➞ "Complete"

getWord("lang", "uage") ➞ "Language"

My Solution

function getWord(left, right) {
 return left.slice(0,1).toUpperCase() + left.slice(1, left.length) + right
}
