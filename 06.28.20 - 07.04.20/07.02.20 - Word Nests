Word Nests
A word nest is created by taking a starting word, and generating a new string by placing the word inside itself. This process is then repeated.

Nesting 3 times with the word "incredible":

start  = incredible
first  = incre|incredible|dible
second = increin|incredible|credibledible
third  = increinincr|incredible|ediblecredibledible
The final nest is "increinincrincredibleediblecredibledible" (depth = 3).

Given a starting word and the final word nest, return the depth of the word nest.

Examples
wordNest("floor", "floor") ➞ 0

wordNest("code", "cocodccococodededeodeede") ➞ 5

wordNest("incredible", "increinincrincredibleediblecredibledible") ➞ 3

My Solution

function wordNest(word, nest) {
	return (nest.length / word.length) -1
}
