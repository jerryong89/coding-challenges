Ping Pong!
A game of table tennis almost always sounds like Ping! followed by Pong! Therefore, you know that Player 2 has won if you hear Pong! as the last sound (since Player 1 didn't return the ball back).

Given an array of Ping!, create a function that inserts Pong! in between each element. Also:

If win equals true, end the list with Pong!.
If win equals false, end with Ping! instead.
Examples
pingPong(["Ping!"], true) ➞ ["Ping!", "Pong!"]

pingPong(["Ping!", "Ping!"], false) ➞ ["Ping!", "Pong!", "Ping!"]

pingPong(["Ping!", "Ping!", "Ping!"], true) ➞ ["Ping!", "Pong!", "Ping!", "Pong!", "Ping!", "Pong"!]

My Solution

function pingPong(arr, win) {
	let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
      result.push(arr[i])
      result.push("Pong!")
    }
    if( win === true){
      return result
    } else return result.slice(0, result.length -1)
}
