Number of Apples Left
A man has n number of apples. If he eats a percentage p of the apples (if apples are available), his children will share the remainder of the apples. Create a function to determine the number of whole apples his children got. If his children did not get any apples, return "The children didn't get any apples".

Examples
getNumberOfApples(10, "90%") ➞ 1

getNumberOfApples(25, "10%") ➞ 22

getNumberOfApples(0, "10%") ➞ "The children didn't get any apples"

My Solution

function getNumberOfApples(n, p) {
	let sub = n * (p.slice(0, p.length - 1) * .01)
	if (Math.floor(n - sub) === 0) {
		return "The children didn't get any apples"
	} else return Math.floor(n - sub)
}
