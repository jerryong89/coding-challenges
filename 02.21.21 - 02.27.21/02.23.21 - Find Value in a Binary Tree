Find Value in a Binary Tree
An array that represents a Binary Tree is in the following form:

binaryTree = [val, arrLeft, arrRight]
When arrLeft is the left side of the tree and arrRight is the right side of the tree.

To illustrate:

const arr1 = [3, [ 8, [ 5, null, null], null], [ 7, null, null]]

// arr1 represents the following Binary Tree:

                    3
                   / \
                  8   7
                 /\   /\
                5  N N  N
               /\
               N N

// Where N represents null.
Create a function that takes an array that represent a Binary Tree and a value and return true if the value is in the tree and, false otherwise.

Examples
valueInTree(arr1, 5) ➞ true

valueInTree(arr1, 9) ➞ false

valueInTree(arr2, 51) ➞ false
Notes
The tree will contain integers only and will be presented by an array in the specified format.

My Solution

function valueInTree(tree, val) {
	let treeCopy = tree.flat(Infinity)
	return treeCopy.includes(val) ? true : false
}
