Reverse the Number
Create a function that takes an integer n and reverses it.

Examples
rev(5121) ➞ "1215"

rev(69) ➞ "96"

rev(-122157) ➞ "751221"
Notes
This challenge is about using two operators that are related to division.
If the number is negative, treat it like it's positive.

My Solution

function rev(n) {
	let positive = Math.abs(n)
	let string =  positive + ""
	let result = "";
	
	for (let i = string.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		result += string[i]
	}
	
	return result
}
