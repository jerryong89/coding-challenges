I'd Like a New Shade of Blue, Please
I have a bucket containing an amount of navy blue paint and I'd like to paint as many walls as possible. Create a function that returns the number of complete walls that I can paint, before I need to head to the shops to buy more.

n is the number of square meters I can paint.
w and h are the widths and heights of a single wall in meters.
Examples
howManyWalls(100, 4, 5) ➞ 5

howManyWalls(10, 15, 12) ➞ 0

howManyWalls(41, 3, 6) ➞ 2

My Solution

function howManyWalls(n, w, h) {
	return Math.floor(n/ (w*h))
}
