Joining Digits Together
Create a function which takes in a number n as input and returns all numbers up to and including n joined together in a string. Separate each digit from each other with the character "-".

Examples
joinDigits(4) ➞ "1-2-3-4"

joinDigits(11) ➞ "1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-1-0-1-1"

joinDigits(15) ➞ "1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-1-0-1-1-1-2-1-3-1-4-1-5"
Notes
Remember to start at 1 and include n as the last number.

My Solution

function joinDigits(n){
	let string = ""
	let string2 = ""
	
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		string += i+1
	}
	
	for (let j = 0; j < string.length; j++) {
		if (j === string.length - 1) {
			string2 += string[j]
		} else
		string2 += string[j]+ "-"
	}
	return string2
}
