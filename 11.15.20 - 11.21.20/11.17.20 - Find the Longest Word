Find the Longest Word
Write a function that will return the longest word in a sentence. In cases where more than one word is found, return the first one.

Examples
findLongest("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") ➞ "forever"

findLongest("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") ➞ "forgetfulness"

findLongest("\"Strengths\" is the longest and most commonly used word that contains only a single vowel.") ➞ "strengths"
Notes
Special characters and symbols don't count as part of the word.
Return the longest word found in lowercase letters.

My Solution

function findLongest(sentence) {
	let copy = sentence.split(" ");
	let length = 0;
	let index = 0;
	let array = /[",", ".", ";", "'"]/g;
	
	for (let i = 0; i < copy.length; i++) {
		if (copy[i].length > length) {
			length = copy[i].length
			index = [i]
		}
	}
	
	let number = copy[index].search(array)
	 if (number === -1) {
		 return copy[index].toLowerCase()
	 }
	return copy[index].slice(0, number).toLowerCase()
}
