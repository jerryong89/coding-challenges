The Missing Link
Your function will get an array with a number sequence. However, one item will be missing. It's your job to find out which one is not in the array.

To illustrate, given the array [1, 3, 4, 5], 2 is missing so the output must be 2.

Examples
missing([1, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ 2

missing([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16]) ➞ 12

missing([1.5, 2, 3]) ➞ 2.5
Notes
The missing item will never be the smallest or largest number in the array.
In every array, exactly one item is missing.

My Solution

function missing(arr) {
	let newArr = [];
	
	for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
		newArr.push(arr[i + 1] - arr[i])
	}

	let low = newArr[0]
	let high = newArr[0]
	let index = 0
	for (let k = 0; k < newArr.length; k++) {
		
		if (high <= newArr[k]) {
			index = k;
			high = newArr[k];
			}
		
		if (low > newArr[k]) {
			low = newArr[k]
		}
			
	}

	return arr[index] + low
}
