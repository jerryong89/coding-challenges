Burglary Series (01): Calculate Total Losses
You just returned home to find your mansion has been robbed! Given an object of the stolen items, return the total amount of the burglary (number). If nothing was robbed, return the string "Lucky you!".

Examples
const stolenItems = {
  tv: 30,
  skate: 20,
  stereo: 50,
} ➞ 100

const stolenItems = {
  painting: 20000,
} ➞ 20000

const stolenItems = {} ➞ "Lucky you!"
Notes
The item value is always positive.
This is my first experience in creating a challenge. I started to learn testing so I decided to give it a go here at Edabit as well. Hope I did it right... Suggestions are very welcome!

My Solution

function calculateLosses(obj) {
	let array = Object.values(obj)
	let result = 0;
	
	for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
		result += array[i]
	}
	
	if (array.length === 0) {
		return "Lucky you!"
	} else return result
}
