Triangular Number Sequence
This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15
This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second one has three dots, the third one has 6 dots and so on.

Write a function that gives the number of dots n with its corresponding triangle number of the sequence.

Examples
triangle(1) ➞ 1

triangle(6) ➞ 21

triangle(215) ➞ 23220

My Solution

function triangle(n) {
	let counter = 1;
	let number = 0;
	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++){
		number = number + counter
		counter++
	}
	return number
}
