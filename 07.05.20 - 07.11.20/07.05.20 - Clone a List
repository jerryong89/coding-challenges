Clone a List
The Code tab has a code which attempts to add a clone of an array to itself. There is no error message, but the results are not as expected. Can you fix the code?

Examples
clone([1, 2, 3]) ➞ [1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3]]

clone(["x", "y"]) ➞ ["x", "y", ["x", "y"]]

My Solution

function clone(arr) {
	let result = [];
	for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
		result.push(arr[i])
	}
	arr.push(result)
	return arr
}
