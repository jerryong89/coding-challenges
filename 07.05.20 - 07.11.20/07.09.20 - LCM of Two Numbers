LCM of Two Numbers
Write a function that returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.

Examples
lcm(9, 18) ➞ 18

lcm(8, 5) ➞ 40

lcm(17, 11) ➞ 187

Notes
Both values will be positive.
The LCM is the smallest integer that divides both numbers such that the remainder is zero.

My Solution

function lcm(n1, n2) {
	let n1array = [n1]
	let n2array = [n2]
	let counter1 = n1
	let counter2 = n2
	for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++){
		n1array.push(counter1+= n1)
		n2array.push(counter2+= n2)
	}
	for (let k = 0; k < n1array.length; k++){
		for (let l = 0; l <n2array.length; l++){
				if (n1array[k] === n2array[l]) {
					return n2array[l]
				}
		}
	}
}
