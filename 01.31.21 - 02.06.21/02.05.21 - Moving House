Moving House
I'd like to calculate how long on average I've lived in a single house.

Given a person's age and the number of times they've moved house as moves, return the average number of years that they've spent living in the same house.

Examples
yearsInOneHouse(30, 1) ➞ 15

yearsInOneHouse(15, 2) ➞ 5

yearsInOneHouse(80, 0) ➞ 80

My Solution

function yearsInOneHouse(age, moves) {
	return Math.round(age / (moves+1))
}
