Which Function Returns the Larger Number?
Your function will be passed two functions, f and g, that don't take any parameters. Your function has to call them, and return a string which indicates which function returned the larger number.

If f returns the larger number, return the string f.
If g returns the larger number, return the string g.
If the functions return the same number, return the string neither.
Examples
whichIsLarger(() => 5, () => 10) ➞ "g"

whichIsLarger(() => 25,  () => 25) ➞ "neither"

whichIsLarger(() => 505050, () => 5050) ➞ "f"
Notes
This exercise is designed as an introduction to higher order functions (functions which use other functions to do their work).

My Solution

function whichIsLarger(f, g) {
	if (f() > g()) {
		return "f"
	} 
	if (f() < g()) {
		return "g"
	} else return "neither"
}
