Regex Series: Initials
Write a regular expression that checks if a string is a valid initial. Valid initials either look like (ex. for Chandler Muriel Bing):

C. B.
C. M. B.
Rules for a valid initial:

Each letter must be upper case.
Each letter must be immediately followed by a period.
There must be exactly one space separating each letter-period pair.
Leading or trailing whitespaces are valid.
Examples
"C. B." ➞ true

"    C. B." ➞ true
// Leading and trailing spaces are OK!

"C. B. k." ➞ false
// One of the initials is lower cased 

"C B" ➞ false
// Missing a dot to immediately follow. 
Notes
This challenge is designed to use RegEx only.
