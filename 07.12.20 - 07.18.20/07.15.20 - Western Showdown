Western Showdown
Wild Roger is participating in a Western Showdown, meaning he has to draw (pull out and shoot) his gun faster than his opponent in a gun standoff.

Given two strings,p1 and p2, return which person drew their gun the fastest. If both are drawn at the same time, return "tie".

Examples
showdown(
  "   Bang!        ",
  "        Bang!   "
) ➞ "p1"

// p1 draws his gun sooner than p2

showdown(
  "               Bang! ",
  "             Bang!   "
) ➞ "p2"

showdown(
  "     Bang!   ",
  "     Bang!   "
) ➞ "tie"

My Solution

function showdown(p1, p2) {
	let first = 0;
	let second = 0;
	for (let i = 0; i < p1.length; i++) {
		if (p1[i] === "B" && p2[i] === "B"){
			return "tie"
		}
		if (p1[i] === "B") {
			first++
			break
		}
		if (p2[i] === "B") {
			second++
			break
		}
	}
	if (first > second) {
		return "p1"
	} else return "p2"
}
