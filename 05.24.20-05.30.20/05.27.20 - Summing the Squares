Summing the Squares
Create a function where given the number n, return the sum of all square numbers up to and including n.

squaresSum(3) ➞ 14
// 1² + 2² + 3² =
// 1 + 4 + 9 =
// 14 
Examples
squaresSum(3) ➞ 14

squaresSum(12) ➞ 650

squaresSum(13) ➞ 819
Notes
Remember that n is included in the total.

My Solution

function squaresSum(n) {
  let counter = 0;
	for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++{
    counter += i*i
  }
  return counter
}
