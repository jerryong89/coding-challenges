Raucous Applause
After an amazing performance, the crowd goes wild! People clap enthusiastically and most claps overlap with each other to create one homogeneous sound.

An overlapped clap is a clap which starts but doesn't finish, as in "ClaClap" (The first clap is cut short and there are overall 2 claps)

Given a string of what the overlapping claps sounded like, return how many claps were made in total.

Examples
countClaps("ClaClaClaClap!") ➞ 4

countClaps("ClClClaClaClaClap!") ➞ 6

countClaps("CCClaClClap!Clap!ClClClap!") ➞ 9

My Solution 

function countClaps(str) {
	let count = 0;
	for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
		if (str[i] === "C"){
			count++
		}
	}
	return count
}
