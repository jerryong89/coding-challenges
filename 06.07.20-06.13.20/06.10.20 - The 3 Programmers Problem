The 3 Programmers Problem
You hired three programmers and you (hopefully) pay them. Create a function that takes three numbers (the hourly wages of each programmer) and returns the difference between the highest-paid programmer and the lowest-paid.

Examples
programmers(147, 33, 526) ➞ 493

programmers(33, 72, 74) ➞ 41

programmers(1, 5, 9) ➞ 8
Notes
Don't forget to return the result.

My Solution

function programmers(one, two, three) {
	let newArray = [one, two, three]
	let high = newArray[0]
	let low = newArray[0]
	for (let i = 0; i < newArray.length; i++){
		if (newArray[i] > high){
			high = newArray[i]
		}
		if (newArray[i] < low){
			low = newArray[i]
		}
	}
	return high - low
}
