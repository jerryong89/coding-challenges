Convert Number to Corresponding Month Name
Create a function that takes a number (from 1 to 12) and returns its corresponding month name as a string. For example, if you're given 3 as input, your function should return "March", because March is the 3rd month.

Number	Month Name
1	January
2	February
3	March
4	April
5	May
6	June
7	July
8	August
9	September
10	October
11	November
12	December
Examples
monthName(3) ➞ "March"

monthName(12) ➞ "December"

monthName(6) ➞ "June"
Notes
You can expect only integers ranging from 1 to 12 as test input.
