Hurdle Jump
Create a function that takes an array of hurdle heights and a jumper's jump height, and determine whether or not the hurdler can clear all the hurdles.

A hurdler can clear a hurdle if their jump height is greater than or equal to the hurdle height.

Examples
hurdleJump([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5) ➞ true

hurdleJump([5, 5, 3, 4, 5], 3) ➞ false

hurdleJump([5, 4, 5, 6], 10) ➞ true

hurdleJump([1, 2, 1], 1) ➞ false

My Solution

function hurdleJump(hurdles, jumpHeight) {
	if(hurdles.length === 0){
		return true
	}
	for(let i = 0; i < hurdles.length; i++){
		if (hurdles[i] >= jumpHeight){
			return false
		} else return true
	}
}
