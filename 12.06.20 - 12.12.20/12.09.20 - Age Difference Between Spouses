Age Difference Between Spouses
Create a function that determines the age difference between spouses in a household. The ages ages in years of the parents and their children are given in an array.

If there is no difference in age between the parents, return "No age difference between spouses". Otherwise, return the difference in years. Check the examples for more clarifications.

Examples
ageDifference([29, 1, 6, 8, 28]) ➞ "1 year"

ageDifference([43, 86, 49, 86]) ➞ "No age difference between spouses."

iageDifference([2, 4, 6, 32, 27]) ➞ "5 years"
Notes
Note the singular "year".
The younger spouse (if the spouses are not the same age) will be older than their oldest child by a minimum of 20 years.
The age difference between spouses will not be more than 18 years.

My Solution

function ageDifference(ages) {
	ages.sort((a,b) => b - a)
	
	if (ages[0] === ages[1]) {
		return  'No age difference between spouses.'
	} else if (ages[0] === ages[1] + 1) {
		return "1 year"
	} else return ages[0] - ages[1] + " years"	
}
