Fix the Broken Code
A student learning JavaScript was trying to make a function that sorts all the letters of a string, but their code is broken, and they can't figure out why.

Spot and fix the error(s) in the code to make the function work.

Examples
sortWord("dcba") ➞ "abcd"

sortWord("Unpredictable") ➞ "Uabcdeeilnprt"

sortWord("pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis") ➞ "aacccccceiiiiiilllmmnnnnooooooooopprrsssstuuv"
Notes
Input is a string.

My Solution

function sortWord(word) {
	return [...word].sort().join("")
}
